# Tracking Attendance by Face Recognition

 This is a project that I made for Microsoft Engage 2022. This project aims to digitalize Attendance Tracking via Face Recognition in order to increase efficiency and to reduce manual work.

## Instructions and Build
In the development of this project, I have used Flask, dlib, Face_recognition, javascript. 
- The user will have to create a images folder that contains train and test folder
- Then upload images in train folder for database
- Create a MARKED_ATTENDANCE.csv file to get the marked attendance and copy its path in lmao.py
- In the app go to Attendance page and capture the image.
- In f_recognize function call, copy the path of test and train directory in lmao.py.
Run the following commads to clone the repo:
